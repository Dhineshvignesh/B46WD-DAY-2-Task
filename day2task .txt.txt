   1 .write a blog on the difference between document and window object ?
  

  Ans:  * The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document  
          where as document object is property of window object that points 
          to the DOM document loaded in that window. You can access a document
           object either using window.
        
        * A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document
          object for manipulation inside the document. The first thing that gets  
         loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that 
         window are stored in the window object.
